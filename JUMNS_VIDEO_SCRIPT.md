## VOICEOVER SCRIPT

---

### COLD OPEN — The Problem (0:00–0:18)

**[SCREEN: Black. Text fades in: "12 apps. 47 notifications. 0 control."]**

**VO:**
"You wake up. Check your calendar. Open your todo app. Check your messages. Open your health tracker. Open your journal. Switch back to your calendar. And your day hasn't even started yet."

**[Text fades to: "What if you didn't have to?"]**

**VO:**
"What if one agent handled all of it — and actually knew what mattered to you?"

---

### INTRO — Meet Jumns (0:18–0:30)

**[SCREEN: Welcome screen — green "J" logo glowing, "YOUR AI LIFE ASSISTANT" tagline, Get Started button]**

**VO:**
"This is Jumns. A personal AI life assistant that doesn't wait for you to ask. It plans your day, tracks your goals, watches your health, and adapts in real time. One conversation. No dashboards. No tab-switching. Just you and an agent that works."

---

### LIVE DEMO — The Chat (0:30–1:05)

**[SCREEN: Chat screen. Agent header shows "Jumns — Active • Proactive Mode". Daily Briefing card visible.]**

**VO:**
"Here's the main screen. It's a conversation — that's it. Every morning, Jumns pushes a Daily Briefing. Weather. Your goals. Today's tasks. A progress ring showing where you stand. You tap 'Start Day' or adjust on the fly."

**[SCROLL to Reminder card: "Evening Run — 6:00 PM"]**

**VO:**
"Reminders surface as cards right in the chat. Done, snooze, skip — one tap. No separate app. No notification graveyard."

**[Type in composer: "How's my running goal going?" — agent responds with Goal Check-in card: 72%, 15/21 km, 12-day streak]**

**VO:**
"Ask anything. The agent pulls your data and responds with rich, interactive cards. This isn't a chatbot giving you text walls — it's structured, actionable information."

---

### DEMO — Goals, Toolkit, Settings (1:05–1:35)

**[TAP Goals tab — Goals & Tasks screen with active goals, today's checklist, upcoming reminders]**

**VO:**
"The Goals tab gives you a focused view. Active goals with streaks and progress. Today's tasks as a checklist. Upcoming reminders. The agent manages these — you just check things off."

**[TAP Toolkit tab — MCP servers connected, A2A agents, skills chips]**

**VO:**
"The Toolkit is where it gets powerful. MCP servers connect external data — weather, calendar, Spotify. A2A agents handle specialized tasks. Skills plug in like apps. This is an extensible platform, not a closed product."

**[TAP Settings tab — Gemini 2.5 Flash model card, agent config, notifications]**

**VO:**
"Settings. Pick your AI model — Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic. Configure your agent's personality. Set when briefings and journal prompts arrive. You own the experience."

---

### DEMO — Voice Mode (1:35–1:50)

**[TAP mic button — Voice Mode overlay. Green orb pulses. Transcription: "What's on my schedule today?"]**

**VO:**
"Tap the mic and you're in Voice Mode. A living orb. Real-time transcription. Hands-free interaction with your agent. Ask, listen, act — no screen required."

---

### THE VISION — What's Next (1:50–2:25)

**[SCREEN: Transition to roadmap visuals — clean text on dark background]**

**VO:**
"But here's where it gets big."

**[Text: "Preventive Health — OpenEHR Integration"]**

"Phase two: continuous health tracking through OpenEHR. Wearable data flowing into the agent. Not just numbers — pattern detection. Your sleep dropped forty minutes this week and your afternoon energy crashed. Jumns connects the dots and suggests a change before you even notice the problem."

**[Text: "Dynamic Goal Intelligence"]**

"Phase three: goals that adapt. Missed your morning run three days straight? The agent doesn't nag — it analyzes your calendar, proposes evening runs, or suggests a lower-friction alternative. Live situation analysis. Continuous recalibration."

**[Text: "Multi-Platform • Agent Marketplace • Enterprise"]**

"Then: iOS, web, multi-channel messaging. An open marketplace for specialized agents — fitness, finance, therapy. And eventually, teams and enterprise."

---

### CLOSE — The Pitch (2:25–2:40)

**[SCREEN: Black. Jumns logo centered. Tagline below.]**

**VO:**
"We believe humans should only do the human part — set goals, make decisions, reflect on what matters. Everything else should be handled by an agent that knows you and works for you."

**[Beat.]**

"This is Jumns. The last assistant you'll ever need."

**[Text fades in: "jumns.ai" — hold 3 seconds]**

### Music
- Lo-fi electronic, minimal. Builds subtly during Vision section. Drops to silence on final line.
- Reference: Tycho "Awake" vibes — warm, forward-moving, not aggressive.

### Visual Style
- All demo footage is direct screen recording from the Android app (or Stitch design comps if pre-APK)
- Roadmap section: clean white text on #102216 dark background, fade transitions
- No stock footage. No generic "person using phone" B-roll. The product speaks.

### Voiceover Direction
- Natural, conversational. Not a commercial announcer.
- Confident but not arrogant. Like explaining your product to a smart friend.
- Slight pause before "This is Jumns" at the end. Let it land.
- Pace: unhurried during demo, builds energy during Vision, slows for the close.
